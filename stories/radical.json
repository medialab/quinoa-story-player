There’s a rush-hour backup approaching the Porte d’Orléans exit on the Périphérique; in front of a BNP Paribas ATM in the Rue de Sèvres, a brief scuffle breaks out between supporters of the Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille football clubs. Two friends from Sciences-Po laugh abashedly, as they recognize one another before one of the few tatty multiplexes remaining on the Champs-Élysées—they’re in line to pick up tickets for the 6:15 showing of an American blockbuster. Not far away, in the Avenue Carnot, a flic pins a suspected purse-snatcher to the wall; affecting nonchalance as he waits for a van to come pick them up, he leans into the man’s back, putting all his weight behind the point of his elbow.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":739,"length":4,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"e59ma","text":"A municipal street-cleaner churns slowly through the streets of the Marais, hosing the day’s grit and dust from the asphalt.

In the Rue Saint-Honoré, a fashion executive urges her two matched Standard Poodles from the back of the black Mercedes that has just deposited her in front of her office. An American backpacker on a post-collegiate month abroad strides forth from the marble gate of Père Lachaise with a shoplifted Gide wedged in the cargo pocket of his fatigue pants.

Even if the car hadn’t been booked on the corporate account, it is also equipped with GPS, and that unit’s accuracy buffer has been set such that it correctly identifies the location at the moment it pulls up to the curb, and tags the booking with the name of the house the executive works for.

The fashion house goes away—pointless in a time when design is generated by algorithmic engines, and clothing fabricated on the desktop—and with it the great contribution of couture to the French economy. The ATM in the Rue de Sèvres goes away, like all of the others strewn around the city, as money comes to reside in the direct transit of encrypted digits from one device to another. The streetwalker goes away; she stops patrolling the Boulevard Ney the moment that virtual erotics are perfected, and the bottom drops out of the market for physical intimacy. The union goes away—hard to organize for solidarity, or press claims on power, when fewer than two out of every ten people retain anything we’d recognize as a job. The Mairie goes away, supplanted by an autonomous entity that lives entirely in code, and yet makes plans, issues contracts and hires workers just like any other municipal government. Increasingly the landscape itself is tuned, simplified, shaped for the needs of its posthuman inhabitants.

The overlay of a blinking outline or contour used as an identification cue has long been a staple of science-fictional information displays, showing up in pop culture as far back as the late 1960s. The earliest appearance I can locate is 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), in which the navigational displays of both the Orion III spaceplane and the exploration vessel Discovery relied heavily on the trope—this, presumably, because in the fictional universe of the film they were produced by the same contractor, IBM.
